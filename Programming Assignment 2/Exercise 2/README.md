# LED HAL Example
This example demonstrates and tests the functionality of the LED HAL, temperature sensor and light sensor.


* Understand the sensor activation, reading, and calibration.


# Supported devices
This example is expected to work off-the-shelf on the following boards:

* All CC13xx/CC26xx devices
* All CC2538 devices

# Make sure
* The makefile and the C file are in the same directory
* Within the makefile the path for the contiki-ng directory CONTIKI = ../path takes to the contiki-ng directory/../

* The thresholds for ambient light sensor and the temperature sensor are set to "50 lux" and "27 deg C" respectively which can be changed according to the surrounding.
