# Programming with Texas Instruments cc2650 Sensor Tags

Performed four programming assignments:
* Introduction to programming Contiki-NG applications by setting up a Contiki-NG development environment, compile Contiki-NG applications, and install them on TI SensorTags. Implemented the fundamental concepts of programming Contiki-NG applications through an exercise in LED control. 
* Learnt about different timers provided by Contiki-NG and utilized various sensors on the sensor tags.
* Introdution to Contiki-NG's network stack, including the network/routing layers and the MAC layer.
* Reads the signal strength of the received packets (RSSI values i.e. Received Signal Strength Indicator)
